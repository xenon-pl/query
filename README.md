helps you study by asking you a question at an interval

# installation
download the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/xenon-pl/query/releases)

# setup
go to the settings tab to add questions. they don't save at this time and im not planning on making them save

you can also change the interval upon which the program asks you a question

# troubleshooting
if the app fails to launch, download [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.18-windows-x64-installer)
